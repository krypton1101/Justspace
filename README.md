# Justspace
It's my first(?) game. I'm going to learn c++, OpenGL, GLSL maybe
## Main idea
is to create cosmoteer-like game... but better :)
## Why am i use C++ and OpenGL?
I've tried to make this game with GODOT, but I can't do module system with it. Why am I don't use Unity? I don't like it. It's SFML in reserve, if I can't do what I want with OpenGL.
## I will use YouTube-tutorial as example and base
