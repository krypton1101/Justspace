# Justspace
It's my first(?) game
I'm going to learn c++, OpenGL, GLSL maybe
## Main idea
is to create cosmoteer-like game...
...but better :)
### Why am i use C++ and OpenGL?
I've tried to make this game with GODOT, but I can't do module system with it.
Why am I don't use Unity?
I don't like it. That's all.
It's SFML in reserve, if I can't do what I want with OpenGL.
